## Summary

V3-SA Aux Panel mod is designed as a drop-in solution which can replace the existing panel V3-SA turbo slider panel. One variation has six 12mm button holes which are large enough to accommodate 12mm buttons, such as Daiertek buttons available on Amazon.com. There is a window for a 128x64 I2C OLED screen. Other variations are provided with holes sized for MX keyboard switches.

The screen used for this mod was purchased here: [OLED link](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832770994631.html). It is the "new" style, which has a smaller PCB than the "original" style. Screw holes might not align if a different screen is used.

The screws used to hold the original aux panel in place can be used to hold this replacement aux panel in place. Assembly is as follows: 
1. Remove entire aux panel and turbo slider PCB.
2. Install windowed panel which can be found in the STL/3mf stored in this repository.
3. Screw OLED screen into frame on inner panel using four M2 screws.
4. Place inner panel and OLED screen around the screw posts inside the controller.
5. Screw assembly into place using original aux panel screws.
6. Drop in and affix suitable buttons (either 12mm buttons or MX keyboard switches, depending on panel variation).
7. Wire screen and aux buttons to your encoder.
