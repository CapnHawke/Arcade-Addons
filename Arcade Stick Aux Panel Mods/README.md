V3-SA Aux Panel mod is designed as a drop-in solution which can replace the existing panel V3-SA turbo slider panel. There are six 12mm button holes which are large enough to accommodate 12mm buttons, such as Daiertek buttons available on Amazon.com. There is a window for a 128x64 I2C OLED screen. 

The screws used to hold the original aux panel in place can be used to hold this replacement aux panel in place. Assembly is as follows: 
1. Remove entire aux panel and turbo slider PCB.
2. Install windowed panel which can be found in the STL/3mf stored in this repository.
3. Screw OLED screen into frame on inner panel using four M2 screws.
4. Place inner panel and OLED screen around the screw posts inside the controller.
5. Screw assembly into place using original aux panel screws.
6. Drop in 12mm buttons and tighten with included button screw nuts.
7. Wire screen and aux buttons to your encoder.
