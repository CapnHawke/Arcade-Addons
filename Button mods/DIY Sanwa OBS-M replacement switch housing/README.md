## Summary

The files available in this repository can be used to create a switch housing for microswitches a.k.a. miniature snap-action switch fitting the D44x form factor. 

Certain arcade buttons, namely those made by Suzo-Happ and Industrias Lorenzo, are well known for their use of Cherry/ZF D44x microswitches, a lightly tactile switch requiring little force to actuate (75 gf), having a short pre-travel and a small movement differential. Installing these switches in a Sanwa or Seimitsu button will completely change the way the button feels.

Compared to a standard Sanwa SW68 switch, the D44x is notably different in the following ways:
- Has a tactile bump at the beginning of travel instead of being linear, providing for a more responsive feel
- Requires slightly more force for the initial press, while not being so heavy as to induce hand fatigue
- Satisfying auditory "click" confirming actuation

These files will allow you to add D44x (or similar) microswitches to your Sanwa OBSF, OBSC, OBSN, or Seimitsu PS-14-DN-K pushbuttons. Please note that although other buttons are expected to be compatible (such as Sanwa OBSJ and Seimitsu PS-14-D series), they are untested as of uploading these files. 

## Design

3mf files have been selected for these files. 3mf files have certain advantages over STL files when loading multiple objects into a single print. 

For reference purposes, the files available in this repository are pictured below.

Sanwa Height Plunger

This plunger should work for Sanwa OBS and Seimitsu PS-14-D based buttons. A version of this plunger to fit HORI Hayabusa buttons is in development.

## Assembly

The following are suggested assembly instructions to install a microswitch in a Sanwa OBSF button. Please note that certain compatible buttons, such as OBSN and PS-14-D-KN, require that the assembly be installed beneath a locking nut which holds the button housing tight against the control panel. For those buttons, the button housing must be installed on the panel *before* the switch is mounted and the plunger is inserted.

Gather all components required for the mod:
- One plunger
- Left side switch housing
- Right side switch housing
- Button
- tools for leverage (can be tweezers, precision screwdriver or other narrow lever tool)
- M3*16 metric screws x2
- Lock washer for M3 screws x2
- M3 nut x2
- Microswitch. For the purposes of visual demonstration, a Mulon VM-23P is pictured. This switch is pictured here for *demonstration purposes only*.

![Parts for Mod](https://github.com/CapnHawke/Arcade-Addons/blob/main/Button%20mods/Images/20231210%20Parts%20for%20mod.jpg)

Once all parts have been gathered, begin by disassembling the button. Use your lever tools to pop out the button plunger and expose the default switch inside the button housing. Pinch the clips holding the ends of the switch inside the button, and push the old switch out. Then, place the new microswitch inside the Left side 3d printed switch housing.

![Step one](https://github.com/CapnHawke/Arcade-Addons/blob/main/Button%20mods/Images/20231210%20First%20assembly%20step.jpg)

Loosely fit the Right side of the switch housing on the assembly, lining up the walls of the switch housing.

![Step two](https://github.com/CapnHawke/Arcade-Addons/blob/main/Button%20mods/Images/20231210%20Second%20assembly%20step.jpg)

Inspect the button housing. The shape of the mounting hole for the switch is rectangular. Orient the 3d printed switch housing so that the microswitch runs parallel to the longer dimension of the mounting hole. Insert the switch housing from beneath, rotating the left and right sides of the switch housing into place, so that they simultaneously slip into the button housing and are held pressure tight inside the button housing. 

![Step three](https://github.com/CapnHawke/Arcade-Addons/blob/main/Button%20mods/Images/20231210%20Third%20assembly%20step.jpg)

From above, the switch and button assembly should look like this:

![Step three top view](https://github.com/CapnHawke/Arcade-Addons/blob/main/Button%20mods/Images/20231210%20Third%20assembly%20step%20top.jpg)

Insert the 3d printed plunger into the underside of the button plunger.

![Step four](https://github.com/CapnHawke/Arcade-Addons/blob/main/Button%20mods/Images/20231210%20Plunger%20assembly%20step.jpg)

Insert M3*16 screws into the screw holes. Fittment will be tight, and gentle pressure may need to be applied to rotate the pieces of the switch housing into place. Secure with M3 lock washers and nuts. A completed mod is shown below, ready for installation in a control panel. Reinstall the button plunger.
