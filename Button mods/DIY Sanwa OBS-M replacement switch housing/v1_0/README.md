## Additional notes
 - When these parts are received, the parts will need to be cut flush from the sprue using a pair of hobby clippers or a box cutter. 
 - These parts have been tested and installed successfully in 30mm Sanwa OBSF buttons, mounted in acrylic panels up to 1/4" thick (or two 1/8" panels). The recommended panel thickness for installation is 1.6mm steel. When installing in 1/4" thick panels, it may be necessary to sand down the bottom corners of the assembly. Doing so will help to fit the completed assembly through a 30mm hole while it is connected to the button housing. If a user is installing into a panel of greater than 1/4" thickness, the switch assembly will need to be installed in the button housing after the button housing is already mounted to the panel.
