## Summary

This RGB LED board was designed for use with the following:
- GP2040-CE gamepad firmware.
- Japanese style arcade levers such as Sanwa JLF, JLX, Seimitsu LS-40, Seimitsu LS-70x, etc.

This LED board hosts a set of eight WS2812 addressable RGB LEDs, which can be assigned to light up at the same time that the up, down, left and right cardinal direction switches are pressed on your joystick. 

Included is a CPL, a BOM, and a Gerber production file. If you want to make changes to the design, .json and .svg files have been exported from EasyEda. EasyEda is recommended to view and edit the .json file, to ensure that all data is retained in its native format.
